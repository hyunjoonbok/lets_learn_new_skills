## Motivation

This repository was have a personal archive of State-of-the-art projects / codes in mostly Deep learning field. 
The codes contained are ready to be used in any industry right-away if well tuned. Tweaked a few parts of posts from original author in order to expedite the learning process in a logical way.

- ### Deep Learning

   #### [Prototypical Networks for Few-Shot-Learning in Pytorch](https://github.com/hyunjoonbok/lets_learn_new_skills/blob/master/Prototypical%20Networks%20for%20Few-Shot-Learning.ipynb): 
   <p>
    Basic walkthrough of Few-shot learning, that's been widely used in image classficiation with a limited training images. Build a model to classify Omniglot dataset (language characters) to correct classes. Using Image2vector CNN model.

   #### [Transfer Learning in Pytorch](https://github.com/hyunjoonbok/lets_learn_new_skills/blob/master/Transfer%20Learning%20in%20Pytorch%20by%20building%20CIFAR-10%20model.ipynb): 
   <p>
    Transfer Learning complete model building by building CIFAR-10 model (VGG16 Pretrained on ImageNet). Freeze the last few layer to fit into CIFAR-10 tasks.

   #### [f-AnoGAN (Image Anomaly Detection) in Pytorch](https://github.com/hyunjoonbok/lets_learn_new_skills/blob/master/f-AnoGAN%20(Image%20Anomaly%20Detection)%20in%20Pytorch%20.ipynb): 
   <p>
   Use Unsupervised leraning method to solve the image anomayl detectcion widely used in medical fields. Craete a Fake image to compare with the real image. Has it's robustness where only a good volumnes of traning images are needed at the beginning, and it takes care of anomaly detection. Pytorch Implementation acheives over 99.5% accuracy in FP/TP and precision/recall.

   #### [Basic Pytorch Concepts in practice by building MNIST CNN model](https://github.com/hyunjoonbok/lets_learn_new_skills/blob/master/Basic%20Pytorch%20Concepts%20in%20practice%20by%20building%20MNIST%20CNN%20model%20.ipynb): 
   <p>
   An all-in-one Pytorch starting codeset, which can be applied to many of real-world image classification tasks

   #### [AlexNet CIFAR-10 Classifier](https://github.com/hyunjoonbok/lets_learn_new_skills/blob/master/AlexNet%20CIFAR-10%20Classifier.ipynb): 
   <p>
   AlexNet algorithm in Pytorch to solve CIFAR-10. Shows a complete step of model building (The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes.[3] The 10 different classes represent airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. There are 6,000 images of each class)
